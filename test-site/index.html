    <p>[An epic creature that will shoot fire at you if you get near it]. 
      You can usually find one outside or near/in a house. 
      Its main abilities are to [chomp] and scratch but they can also pounce, 
      shoot lasers out of their eyes, be cute, jump as high as they want, and fly. 
      Do not fight one unless you are equipped with extreme power armor and heavy assault cannons. 
      It is also better to bring multiple friends. 
      Don't say I didnt warn you when you get [vaporized] from being fooled by its cuteness.</p>
